I've reviewed the code changes in the `../my-agent` directory. Here's my feedback, file by file:

### `index.ts`

**Summary:** This file introduces a new `codeReviewAgent` function, shifting from a simple text generation to a more sophisticated streaming agent setup with system prompts and tool integration. This is a significant and positive architectural change.

**Detailed Review & Suggestions:**

1.  **New Agent Architecture:**
    *   **Praise:** The move to an `async codeReviewAgent` function using `streamText` is a substantial improvement. It encapsulates the agent's logic, allows for real-time output, and integrates tools, making the agent much more capable and extensible.
    *   **Praise:** The use of `system: SYSTEM_PROMPT` is excellent for providing clear instructions and context to the model, ensuring consistent behavior.
    *   **Praise:** Integrating `tools` (getFileChangesInDirectory, generateCommitMessage, createMarkdownFile) directly into the agent's capabilities is the core of making it an effective code reviewer.

2.  **Stopping Condition (`stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)`):**
    *   **Suggestion:** `10` is a "magic number" here. While `stepCountIs` is a good mechanism for controlling agent execution and preventing infinite loops, consider making this value configurable (e.g., through an environment variable or a parameter to `codeReviewAgent`). This would allow for easier tuning based on the complexity of the tasks the agent performs.
        ```typescript
        // Example of making it configurable
        const MAX_AGENT_STEPS = parseInt(process.env.MAX_AGENT_STEPS || '10', 10);

        const result = streamText({
            // ...
            stopWhen: stepCountIs(MAX_AGENT_STEPS),
        });
        ```

3.  **Error Handling:**
    *   **Suggestion:** There's no explicit error handling for the `streamText` call or within the `for await` loop. While the AI SDK might handle some errors internally, it's good practice to wrap the agent's execution in a `try...catch` block to gracefully manage potential issues (e.g., API errors, network problems, or tool execution failures).
        ```typescript
        const codeReviewAgent = async (prompt: string) => {
            try {
                const result = streamText({
                    // ...
                });

                for await (const chunk of result.textStream) {
                    process.stdout.write(chunk);
                }
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Code Review Agent failed:", error);
                // Optionally, rethrow or perform other error recovery
            }
        };
        ```

### `package.json`

**Summary:** New dependencies `simple-git` and `zod` have been added, which are crucial for the new agent functionality.

**Detailed Review & Suggestions:**

1.  **New Dependencies (`simple-git`, `zod`):**
    *   **Praise:** The addition of `simple-git` is appropriate and necessary for tools that interact with a Git repository (e.g., getting file changes or generating commit messages).
    *   **Praise:** The inclusion of `zod` is an excellent choice. It provides robust schema validation, which will be invaluable for defining and validating inputs and outputs of the agent's tools. This significantly improves type safety, maintainability, and robustness.

2.  **Dependency Type:**
    *   **Comment:** The new dependencies are correctly listed under `dependencies`. Assuming these libraries are used at runtime by the agent for its core functionality, this is the correct category. If they were exclusively for development-time scripts or build processes, `devDependencies` would be more suitable, but that doesn't appear to be the case here.

Overall, these changes represent a well-thought-out evolution towards a more capable and structured AI agent. Good job on modularizing the prompts and tools!
